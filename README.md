# Giovainni's Sandwiches

This project is a coding exercise which was fun :). See it online at https://giovannis-sandwiches.vercel.app

## How to run the project
Install the project dependencies by running `npm i` and run the project with `npm run dev`. Bare in mind that running it locally will not be possible without providing a MongoDB connection string like in the env.example file.

## Testing

To run the tests use `npm test`.
